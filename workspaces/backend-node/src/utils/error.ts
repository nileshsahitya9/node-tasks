/**
 * Distinguishing the following two error types will minimize your app downtime and helps avoid crazy bugs:
 * Operational errors refer to situations where you understand what happened and the impact of it –
 * for example, a query to some HTTP service failed due to connection problem.
 * On the other hand, programmer errors refer to cases where you have no idea why and sometimes where an error came from –
 * it might be some code that tried to read an undefined value or DB connection pool that leaks memory.
 * Operational errors are relatively easy to handle – usually logging the error is enough.
 * Things become hairy when a programmer error pops up,
 * the application might be in an inconsistent state and there’s nothing better you can do than to restart gracefully
